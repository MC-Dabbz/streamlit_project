# streamlit_project

This code basically derives various insights from the data in the gender dataset.
So far I have put a table that shows the information in the dataset
I have drawn various graphs(bar_graph and pi_chart) that show the relationships between various elements in the data set

This project is mainly for me to practice the various elements I learnt in the Computer Training Unit from the DARA Astronomy Basic Training Program.
As I learn even more about Data Analysis and Computer Programing, I hope to come back to this project and improve it even futher.
